Kubernetes role for Ansible
===========================

This role is based liberally on the [practices for running Kuberntes on Fedora Server described in the Fedora project documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/using-kubernetes-kubeadm/).

Attempts have been made to write the role in a way that will support the addition of other distributions through addition of variables only, but may take some tweaking to get working.

Written and tested on Fedora 41.
